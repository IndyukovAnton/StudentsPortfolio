        <h2>History of the Golden Gate Bridge</h2>
        <p>
            The Golden Gate Bridge, completed in 1937, is an iconic suspension bridge connecting San Francisco to Marin County. 
            The bridge's construction was a marvel of engineering and it held the record as the longest suspension bridge main span in the world until 1964. 
            It was designed by engineer Joseph Strauss, with contributions from architect Irving Morrow and structural engineer Charles Alton Ellis.
